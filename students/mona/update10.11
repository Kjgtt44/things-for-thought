Update from last week: 

Since tuesday I read a paper about perception and music. While reading I created audio files corrresponnding to the phenomenoms discribed in the paper.
I researched more into the effects of masking in psychacoustics and created corrensponding audio files to the experiements mentioned in the papers by hugo fastl. 
I still used VCV Rack for that even though I did't make new progress trying to set up a coding space for own plug ins. 
Even though that is still in my To Do list I also started learning to use MSP Max 9. Which seems to be an easier route to `code` plug in systems with already existing patches of code that just need assembling.
For this week I plan to further dive into the topic of masking since I feel like I just scratched the basics and got to know terminology of it this week. 
Hugo Fastls research is based on masking regarding noise and frequency. While reading his paper I wrote down a few ideas I feel that are woth of exploring in MSP Max / VCV Rack. 
But I first want to finish and summarize the two studies mentioning it.
