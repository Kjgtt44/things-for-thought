Awareness and Respect during the hunt
We donâ€™t have to hunt anymore. It only makes sense that over the course of time we have lost the connection to the awareness we used to have when hunting or later taking a life of a farm animal. Today we go to the grocery store and buy a piece of meat fully prepared for cooking, not having to think about where it came from and feeling gratitude and respect. The process of butchering is hidden for most and seeing blood or bones is repulsive. The majority cancel out the background and enjoy their food without being aware. 
I found inspiration in the way native Americans have dealt with this topic and their great bond to nature and the circle of life.
Taking a step back and reconnecting with the reality of this matter and enjoying food with gratitude and awareness might help with our own relationship with food and excessive consumerism.
