# Week 3 Announcements

Thanks everybody for a great second week.
Congratulation on your pull requests! As a follow up, here's your briefing for your *next quest*:
Create a folder and a file in the students folder. Both should have the same name as you :-) Here you will write a small journal that documents your process. Please start with an entry on your current thoughts on your project direction. The more finish before next week, the better I can support you by providing resources and directions! Don't forget to submit the pull request! ;-)

This repository is configured to automatically render the markdown to a website that you can find [here](https://saeneas.github.io/things-for-thought).

## What's next
Take another look at the slides from this week and align your process with the schedule.
By next week you should have 
- a direction you want to research. You need to decide yourself how specific or broad you want to start. If helpful, select reference projects.
- and what you think you need to learn in order to support your project.
We will do check-ins for directions and also learning subjects on monday, so we can create some peer learning and feedback structures and I can put together some resources for you.
For this, please write a three-line paragraph on your direction

## Reading Recommendations

As some of you asked for further reading suggestions, here's a couple:
*Paul Dourish - Where the action is (Book)*
HCI classic about the situatedness of actions and the meaning of contextuality in HCI and design.

*Lucy Suchman - Human Machine Reconfigurations*
A seminal HCI reading on situatedness, contextuality, context and brittleness of meaning.
Also language driven account on the human ability to create shared meaning through language and action.
A harder read than the others.

*Don Norman - Design of everyday things*
Although some of you have already read it, I will also recommend this book on the intersection of design and HCI as an essential reading.
It is a lot more approachable than the other two books, and a good introduction to some of the jargon and terminology.
