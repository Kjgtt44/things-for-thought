# Week 4 Announcements

Hey everybody,
all of you came of with great directions for your research and I'm very excited for what you come up with!
In the slides folder, find the mandatory reading assignments: Everyone needs to skim all articles, and then select one of them to thoroughly read. I recommend using one of the academic reading techniques referenced in class (also on one of the slides, there is a link). Please coordinate in order to avoid all of you selecting the same article.
The task is MANDATORY :-), so even if it seems challenging in the beginning, I assure that you will, long or short term, benefit a lot from being able to incorporate reading articles and papers into your research process. 

### Reading assignments
- [Excerpt on situated actions - Lucy Suchman](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs5100f12/resources/reading/suchman-situatedactions.pdf)
- [What we talk about when we talk about context - Dourish](https://www.academia.edu/download/50627076/Dourish.pdf)
- [On the transition from second to third wave HCI - Susanne Bødtker](https://pure.au.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/93115128/nordichipreprint.pdf)

### Coding primer
We will start with the coding classes in two weeks, so I thought for some of you, who have very few prior experiences with coding, it would be helpful to get accustomed to some of the terminology and get an overview. Here's the [video referenced in class on the basics of coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E). There's many many videos like this out there, so if this doesn't suit you, please find ones that work better for you and also most importantly *share*. (you can add them here via pull request).
### Github
I will continue adding you as contributors to the repository today.. 

## What's next
For next weeks feedback rounds, please start communication your ideas through sketches, doodles, text, presentations, slides, any format that you think suits your process and project best. # Thinking

# Things For Thought - Week 3 Summary

## Reading Club: Affordances Discussion
The session focused on an in-depth analysis of affordances in design and HCI. The discussion explored how affordances emerge through use, and examined the natural boundaries of how people's perceptions of affordances can be shaped. Special attention was given to mental models and the importance of internal representations in design, both explicit and implicit.

## Critical Analysis of Gibsonian Affordances
The class examined several shortcomings of traditional Gibsonian affordance concepts. A key discussion point was Baerentsen and Trettvik's (2002) observation that while affordances were meant to transcend the subjective-objective dichotomy, HCI interpretations often maintained this division. The discussion emphasized how user-technology interaction involves active interpretation within social and cultural contexts.

## Extended Understanding of Affordances
Recent studies by Turner (2006), Rizzo (2006), and Vyas et al. (2006, 2008) propose expanding the concept of affordances to encompass meaning-making in social contexts. The course material highlighted how traditional Gibsonian concepts may be limited to describing only basic affordances, suggesting the need for a more comprehensive framework that includes cultural, social, and political dimensions.

## Semantic Turn in Design
The session introduced Klaus Krippendorff's "The Semantic Turn, A New Foundation for Design," which addresses the somewhat absent cultural, social, and political aspects of affordance theory. This theoretical framework positions semantics and meaning-making as fundamental materials for design practice.

## Academic Reading Techniques
The course introduced advanced reading strategies, moving beyond traditional front-to-back reading approaches. Special emphasis was placed on the SQ3R method (available at https://ucc.vt.edu/academic_support/study_skills_information/sq3r_reading-study_system.html), encouraging students to develop more effective reading and retention strategies.

## Additional HCI Resources
Several key texts were recommended for further study:
- "When second wave HCI meets third wave challenges" by Susanne Bødker (https://pure.au.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/93115128/nordichipreprint.pdf)
- "What we talk about when we talk about context" by Paul Dourish (https://www.academia.edu/download/50627076/Dourish.pdf)
- "Plans and Situated Actions" by Lucy Suchman (https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs5100f12/resources/reading/suchman-situatedactions.pdf)

## Course Progression
The session marked the end of the early research phase. Moving forward, classes will shift to a consultation-based format where students must bring concrete materials (sketches, storyboards, presentations, or prototypes) for discussion. The emphasis is on demonstrable progress and honest communication about project development.

## Upcoming Changes
Starting November 19th, the course will incorporate coding sessions from 9-11 AM. An introduction to Programming and Computer Science course will be integrated into the curriculum. Students are expected to prepare for this transition by reviewing basic programming concepts.

## Project Expectations
Students are now expected to move beyond conceptual discussions ("I was thinking...") to tangible demonstrations of progress. While setbacks are understood as part of the process, students should be prepared to articulate their challenges and proposed solutions clearly.

# Week 3 Announcements

Thanks everybody for a great second week.
Congratulation on your pull requests! As a follow up, here's your briefing for your *next quest*:
Create a folder and a file in the students folder. Both should have the same name as you :-) Here you will write a small journal that documents your process. Please start with an entry on your current thoughts on your project direction. The more finish before next week, the better I can support you by providing resources and directions! Don't forget to submit the pull request! ;-)

## What's next
Take another look at the slides from this week and align your process with the schedule.
By next week you should have 
- a direction you want to research. You need to decide yourself how specific or broad you want to start. If helpful, select reference projects.
- and what you think you need to learn in order to support your project.
We will do check-ins for directions and also learning subjects on monday, so we can create some peer learning and feedback structures and I can put together some resources for you.
For this, please write a three-line paragraph on your direction 

*Preliminary Program:*
Monday  
10 Reading club & some input.  
12 Topic and learning 1:1 I  
13 Lunch   
14 Topic discussion and critique continued.  
15 - 17 Work on your projects.   
  
Tuesday  
10 Meet and weekly input  
11 Work on your projects  
13 Lunch

## Weekly Summaries
First, find a summary of this week [here](sessions/week-2.md) and last week [here](sessions/week-1.md).
You can find the slides in the same folder.

## Reading Recommendations

As some of you asked for further reading suggestions, here's a couple:
*Paul Dourish - Where the action is (Book)*
HCI classic about the situatedness of actions and the meaning of contextuality in HCI and design.

*Lucy Suchman - Human Machine Reconfigurations*
A seminal HCI reading on situatedness, contextuality, context and brittleness of meaning.
Also language driven account on the human ability to create shared meaning through language and action.
A harder read than the others.

*Don Norman - Design of everyday things*
Although some of you have already read it, I will also recommend this book on the intersection of design and HCI as an essential reading.
It is a lot more approachable than the other two books, and a good introduction to some of the jargon and terminology.
