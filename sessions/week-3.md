# Things For Thought - Week 3 Slides Summary

## Reading Club: Affordances Discussion
The session focused on an in-depth analysis of affordances in design and HCI. The discussion explored how affordances emerge through use, and examined the natural boundaries of how people's perceptions of affordances can be shaped. Special attention was given to mental models and the importance of internal representations in design, both explicit and implicit.

## Critical Analysis of Gibsonian Affordances
The class examined several shortcomings of traditional Gibsonian affordance concepts. A key discussion point was Baerentsen and Trettvik's (2002) observation that while affordances were meant to transcend the subjective-objective dichotomy, HCI interpretations often maintained this division. The discussion emphasized how user-technology interaction involves active interpretation within social and cultural contexts.

## Extended Understanding of Affordances
Recent studies by Turner (2006), Rizzo (2006), and Vyas et al. (2006, 2008) propose expanding the concept of affordances to encompass meaning-making in social contexts. The course material highlighted how traditional Gibsonian concepts may be limited to describing only basic affordances, suggesting the need for a more comprehensive framework that includes cultural, social, and political dimensions.

## Semantic Turn in Design
The session introduced Klaus Krippendorff's "The Semantic Turn, A New Foundation for Design," which addresses the somewhat absent cultural, social, and political aspects of affordance theory. This theoretical framework positions semantics and meaning-making as fundamental materials for design practice.

## Academic Reading Techniques
The course introduced advanced reading strategies, moving beyond traditional front-to-back reading approaches. Special emphasis was placed on the SQ3R method (available at https://ucc.vt.edu/academic_support/study_skills_information/sq3r_reading-study_system.html), encouraging students to develop more effective reading and retention strategies.

## Mandatory reading for next week

- "When second wave HCI meets third wave challenges" by Susanne BÃ¸dker (https://pure.au.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/93115128/nordichipreprint.pdf)
- "What we talk about when we talk about context" by Paul Dourish (https://www.academia.edu/download/50627076/Dourish.pdf)
- "Plans and Situated Actions" by Lucy Suchman (https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs5100f12/resources/reading/suchman-situatedactions.pdf)

## Course Progression
The session marked the end of the early research phase. Moving forward, classes will shift to a consultation-based format where students must bring concrete materials (sketches, storyboards, presentations, or prototypes) for discussion. The emphasis is on demonstrable progress and honest communication about project development.

## Upcoming Changes
Starting November 19th, the course will incorporate coding sessions. An introduction to Programming and Computer Science course will be integrated into the curriculum. Students are expected to prepare for this transition by reviewing basic programming concepts.

## Project Expectations
You are now expected to move beyond conceptual discussions ("I was thinking...") to tangible demonstrations of progress. While setbacks are understood as part of the process, you should be prepared to articulate their challenges and proposed solutions clearly.
