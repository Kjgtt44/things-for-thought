# Things For Thought - Week 3 Slides Summary

## (Un)learning lab I

### How is project learning different from other learning processes?
- I argue that there is a scoping phase, where you gain some high level orientation of what you need to learn to achieve your project goals.  
  A second phase that is more structured, where you follow through with literature review, tutorials etc. you scoped in the initial phase.  
  An implementation phase where learning and memorizing isn't that much of a priority because things just need to work out in the end and nobody cares how.

## What are the goals of project learning
- We collaboratively collect a number of goals that might be specific to project learning

## A couple of things I suggest are especially important for project learning
- It's doing focusd, as you often apply what you're researching from day one. This being the case in ideation and prototyping.
- It's not built around the standard literature of a discipline, as you can freely choose your resources. It is futile to recreate the traditional learning paths of other disciplines in the short amount of time available for a normal project.  
- Continuous reflection is especially important, when you can't follow a standard curriculum and constantly need to evaluate where to look next.  
  - Often reflecting on the technologies you learn, why they have developed this way can give you additional insights.  
- What you learn is often fleeting. As you skim through a lot of knowledge, memorization is especially hard. What is worth memorizing, what techniques work for you?
- Use the abstractions you build consciously and revise if necessary.
